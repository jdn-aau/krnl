 One note before starting:


\section  a1 Before you start

All initialization must be carried out after k_init and BEFORE k_start

So no creation of semaphores, tasks, etc when the system is running.

Why ? because we are dealing with embedded systems and once your system is configured it shall just run.

I do also really advise not to use dynamic memory after k_start: no malloc and free when your system is running.

If ... you need to do so please protect memory by a mutex (semaphore + k_wait and k_signal) or just encapsule malloc in DI() and EI().
And never never use and rely on free. You may end up with fragmented memory which on the long run is of no use.

So the advise is to

- create all tasks, semaphores etc
- allocate what is needed of memory, resources etc
- and then k_start

\section a112 Memory usage

Use freeRam for testing (part of krnl)

- Task descriptor 17B
- Semaphore descriptor 17B
- Message Queue descriptor 33B (17B for semaphore + 16B)


On the 1280/2560 a few more bytes is used due to extended program counter register

KRNL itself uses approx 190B before allocating task/sem/msgQ descriptors

\section a3 Initialization
If any call fails (like no more RAM or bad parameters) KRNL will not start but will return an error code in k_start
- int k_init(int nrTask, int nrSem, int nrMsg);
- int k_start(int tm); // tm in milliseconds

\section a4 Creation calls - before k_start
\subsection a41 Semaphore
- struct k_t * k_crt_sem(char init_val, int maxvalue);
\subsection a42 Task
- struct k_t * k_crt_task(void (*pTask)(void), char prio, char *pStk, int stkSize);
\subsection a43 Message Queue
- struct k_msg_t * k_crt_send_Q(int nr_el, int el_size, void *pBuf);


\section a55 Semaphore runtime calls
\subsection a5 User space
- char k_set_sem_timer(struct k_t * sem, int val);
- char k_signal(struct k_t * sem);
- char k_wait(struct k_t * sem, int timeout);

\subsection a51 ISR space
_i indicates that no lock/unlock(disable/enable) is carried out

- char ki_signal(struct k_t * sem);
- char ki_nowait(struct k_t * sem);
- char ki_wait(struct k_t * sem, int timeout);
- int ki_semval(struct k_t * sem);

\section a61 Message Queue calls
\subsection a611 User space
- char k_send(struct k_msg_t *pB, void *el);
- char k_receive(struct k_msg_t *pB, void *el, int timeout, int *lost_msg);

\subsection a612 ISR space
- char ki_send(struct k_msg_t *pB, void *el);
- char ki_receive(struct k_msg_t *pB, void *el, int * lost_msg);

\section a8 Task calls
- void ki_task_shift(void) __attribute__ ((naked));
- char k_sleep(int time);
- char k_set_prio(char prio);
- int k_stk_chk(struct k_t *t);

\section a9 Div calls
- int k_unused_stak(struct k_t *t);
- int freeRam(void);
