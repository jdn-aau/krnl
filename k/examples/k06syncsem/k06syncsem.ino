// one task loops and blink
// k_wait on a semaphore ensures proper timing

// task2 is using partly k_eat_ticks in the loop
// Try to lower tasl2 priority to 11 and see what happens
//?: what do you observe ?
// hint k_eat_ticks mimic cpu usage so if a task uses 2000 ticks cpu time then it should not
// have high(est) priority because lower priority task will then starve: not getting cpu time
//
// If you as starting point gives all same prioriryt there is a high chance taht all will more or less get
// what the need.

// even better is to give high priority task (like sampling and control) a high priority
//
// you can mimic high cpu usage for task1 with insertion of a k_eat_ticks in the code below (is commented out)

// The commented out eat uses 90 ticks so task1 will use 90 out of 100 (the time in loop) of the CPU
// or 90% of cpu power ...
// Beware of high prority task using a lot of cpu power
// life is life

// ?: what will happen if equal priorities and the k_eat_ticks(90)  in task1 ?
// when task2 is uÂ´ni the k_eat_ticks(2000) then it will be in competition with task1
// the have same priority so they will share cpu time (round robbin)
// So it will take 180 ticks for task1 to execute k_eat_ticks(90) and at same time task2 will et 90 ticks
//
// At the same time the krnl signals to semaphore  s1 every 100 ticks. But a loop will take 180 ticks. So
// will will come behind with 80 ticks for every loop(when task2 i in k_eat_ticks(2000)

// you can see than k_Semval will never pass 50. This is because k_crt_sem is called with 50 as max.
//
// ?: can you model it ?
